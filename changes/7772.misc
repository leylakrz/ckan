Tracking feature has been moved to its own core extension. Therefore, `ckan.tracking_enabled`
configuration option should be changed to adding `tracking` to CKAN's plugins list.

`g.tracking_enabled` attribute no longer exist.

`tracking_summary` info will be returned if the extension is enabled. `include_tracking`
parameter is no longer required.
